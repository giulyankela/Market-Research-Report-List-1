<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Frequency Identification Transponder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive</li><li>Active</li><li>Semi Active</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transponder market includes three main types: passive, active, and semi-active transponders. Passive transponders do not have a battery and rely on energy from the RFID reader to function, making them cost-effective and ideal for inventory tracking. Active transponders have their own power source, allowing for longer read ranges and additional features, suitable for real-time tracking. Semi-active transponders combine both, using a battery for certain functions while relying on the reader for communication, offering a balance between performance and cost.</p></p>
