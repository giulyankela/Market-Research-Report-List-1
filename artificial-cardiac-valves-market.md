<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Cardiac Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Heart Valves</li><li>Biological/Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Transcatheter Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial cardiac valves market is segmented into three main types: mechanical heart valves, biological/tissue heart valves, and transcatheter heart valves. Mechanical heart valves are durable, made from materials like metal or carbon, and require lifelong anticoagulation therapy. Biological heart valves, derived from animal or human tissue, offer a more natural option but typically have a shorter lifespan. Transcatheter heart valves are minimally invasive, designed for patients who are high-risk for traditional surgery, allowing for effective treatment with reduced recovery time.</p></p>
